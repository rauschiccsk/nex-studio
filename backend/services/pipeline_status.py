"""Deterministic parser for the agent status block (F-007 §5.3, CR-NS-018 Phase 2).

Every orchestrated agent response ends with a machine-readable block::

    <<<PIPELINE_STATUS>>>
    { "stage": "...", "kind": "...", "summary": "...", "awaiting": "...",
      "deliverables": [...], "commits": [...], "question": "..." }
    <<<END_PIPELINE_STATUS>>>

The parser is **deterministic** — any deviation (missing/duplicate fence,
invalid JSON, schema/enum violation, ``question``-required-but-absent) returns
a :class:`ParseFailure`. The orchestrator maps that to ``status=blocked`` +
escalation and **never guesses** (F-007 §5.3, §11.3).

Charter §5.3 contract (per Dedo 2026-06-03):
* ``recipient`` is NOT emitted by agents — derived by the orchestrator. Any
  extra field is ignored, not required.
* ``kind=blocked`` carries the blocker in ``question`` (authoritative);
  ``summary`` is human context.
* ``commits`` / ``deliverables`` may be omitted or empty — default to ``[]``.

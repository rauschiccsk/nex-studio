"""Service layer for the per-project specs browser (``/api/v1/project-specs``).

Browses the **real filesystem** under ``/opt/projects/<slug>/docs/`` for
any project that physically exists on disk. The router layer applies
RBAC (ri only for the v1 cut) and path-traversal validation before
invoking this service.

Director directive 2026-05-14: Project Specs must reflect what is
actually on disk — all file types (not just ``.md``) and empty
directories that the user has created (e.g. ``import/``, ``export/``).
The previous ``.md``-only filter hid CSV / XLSX inputs and made empty
folders look like they didn't exist.

Single source of truth — these files are produced and edited by the
three agents (Designer / Implementer / Auditor) directly in the
project repo. The UI exposed by this service is read-mostly with a
Director (ri) override for typo fixes on Markdown files (write/edit
still restricted to ``.md`` — non-Markdown editing is out of scope).

Design notes:
- Scans ``/opt/projects/<slug>/docs/`` recursively for files **and**
  for directories that are empty (so the user sees them in the tree).
- Hidden directories (``.git``, ``__pycache__``, ``node_modules``, ...)
  are skipped — mirrors the KB scanner pattern.
- All returned paths are ``<slug>/docs/...`` (relative to
  ``/opt/projects``), which is the format KbTree expects for the
  unified hierarchical view.
- ``read_content`` returns text for whitelisted extensions; binary
  files yield ``is_text=False`` so the frontend can render a fallback
  message instead of garbage.
- ``write_content`` remains ``.md``-only (Director scope: typo fixes on
  spec docs, not editing CSV / config / binary).

"""Service layer for :class:`~backend.db.models.architect.ArchitectMessage`.

Provides the synchronous CRUD surface used by API routers. All methods
accept ``db: Session`` as the first argument and only ever call
``session.flush()`` — transaction commit is the router's responsibility.
Errors are signalled via :class:`ValueError` so the router can translate
them to the appropriate HTTP status code.

Design notes (per DESIGN.md §1.12 ArchitectMessage, §1.5 Architect
Sessions / ``architect_messages`` table, D-08 SSE streaming, and
:mod:`backend.db.models.architect.ArchitectMessage`):

    * ``id``, ``created_at`` and ``updated_at`` are server-managed and
      therefore immutable from the service layer (``updated_at`` is
      auto-stamped by the ORM via ``onupdate=func.now()`` on flush).
    * ``session_id``, ``role`` and ``content`` are immutable once the
      row is persisted — Architect chat history is **append-only** per
      DESIGN.md §1.5 ("Streaming: The message row is written after the
      stream completes with final token counts"). A message always
      belongs to exactly one session, with a fixed role and fixed
      content, for its lifetime. :class:`ArchitectMessageUpdate`
      deliberately omits those columns and the service's
      ``allowed_fields`` allow-list enforces that contract defensively.
    * ``role`` is constrained by the ``ck_architect_messages_role`` DB
      CHECK (``user | assistant``). The Pydantic
      :data:`~backend.schemas.architect_message.ArchitectMessageRole`
      literal mirrors the DB constraint, so the service does not
      revalidate — if an invalid value ever reaches the service (e.g.
      a bypassed schema) the DB CHECK rejects it on flush.
    * ``input_tokens``, ``output_tokens`` and ``cost_usd`` are the only
      mutable columns. They are typically ``NULL`` at creation (the
      row is written before the SSE stream completes) and backfilled
      via :func:`update` with the final accounting once the assistant
      turn terminates. They can also be corrected retroactively if
      Anthropic reports a billing adjustment.
    * ``ArchitectMessage`` has **no** UNIQUE constraints beyond the PK
      — a session may contain many messages with the same role and
      even identical content (e.g. the user repeating a prompt).
      :func:`create` therefore performs no pre-flush natural-key
      check. If ``session_id`` does not match an existing row the
      DB-level FK rejects the flush and the error propagates as-is.
    * ``architect_messages`` has **no inbound foreign keys** — no
      other table references it. :func:`delete` performs no dependency
      check and is a straightforward hard-delete. In normal operation
      chat history is retained; :func:`delete` is reserved for test
      fixtures / admin redaction tooling.
    * List filters (``session_id``, ``role``) match the indexed column
      (``ix_architect_messages_session_id``) and support the Architect
      UI (DESIGN.md §3.1 ``ArchitectPage``) — "load the full
      conversation for this session", "show only assistant turns for
      token-usage accounting".
    * List ordering is ``created_at ASC`` so messages appear in
      conversation order (oldest first) — the natural rendering for a
      chat transcript. This deliberately differs from
      :mod:`backend.services.architect_session`, which orders sessions
      newest-first for the session list view.
